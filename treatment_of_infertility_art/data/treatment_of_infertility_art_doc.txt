1) Advanced reproductive technology services:
Eligible health services include Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) services. ART services are more advanced medical procedures or treatments.

1a) ART services:
ART services include:
	• In vitro fertilization (IVF) for fertility preservation
	• Cryopreservation (freezing) and storage for eggs, embryos, sperm or reproductive tissue for fertility preservation

1b) Fertility preservation:
Fertility preservation involves the retrieval of mature eggs and/or sperm or the creation of embryos that are frozen for future use.
You are eligible for fertility preservation only when you:
	• Are believed to be fertile
	• Have planned services that will result in infertility such as:
		• Chemotherapy
		• Pelvic radiotherapy
		• Other gonadotoxic therapies
		• Ovarian or testicular removal
Along with the eligibility requirements above, you are eligible for fertility preservation benefits if, for example:
	• You, your partner or dependent child are planning treatment that is demonstrated to result in infertility. Planned treatments include:
		• Bilateral orchiectomy (removal of both testicles)
		• Bilateral oophorectomy (removal of both ovaries)
		• Hysterectomy (removal of the uterus)
		• Chemotherapy or radiation therapy that is established in medical literature to result in infertility
	• The eggs that will be retrieved for use are reasonably likely to result in a successful pregnancy by meeting the FSH level and ovarian responsiveness criteria outlined in Aetna’s infertility clinical policy.
The following are not covered under the infertility treatment benefit:
	• ART services are not provided for out-of-network care

2) Aetna infertility clinical policy bulletin:

2a) Some plans exclude coverage of Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) using a woman's own eggs for women with poor ovarian reserve. Ovarian reserve is determined by measurement of menstrual cycle day 3 serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) drawn after the normal onset of menstruation, or after progesterone induced menstruation for women who do not reliably menstruate. For women 39 years of age and older, ovarian responsiveness is determined by measurement of day 3 FSH obtained within the prior 6 months. For women who are less than 40 years of age, the day 3 FSH must be less than 19 mIU/mL in their most recent laboratory test to use their own eggs. For women 40 years of age and older, their unmedicated day 3 FSH must be less than 19 mIU/mL in all prior tests to use their own eggs.

2b) For women 40 years of age and older with premature ovarian failure, the day 3 FSH must be less than 19 mIU/mL in their most recent laboratory test to use their own eggs.
