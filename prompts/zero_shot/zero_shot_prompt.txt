- I have provided below all of the text that pertains to a coverage (or section) of a health insurance policy.
	- The text defines all conditions and exclusions that determine whether a patient's claim is covered under this coverage of the policy.
- Please encode a Prolog rule, ‘covered(C)’, which is true exactly when the patient's claim, ‘C’, is covered.
	- I have also provided below a set of claim facts that will be defined in any Prolog query to the 'covered(C)' rule.
		- These are of the form 'claim_Fact(C, Value)', meaning they will be defined for the claim 'C' by filling in a value for Value (this is an input argument for the claim).
		- Under each of these facts, I have listed the valid inputs (or in some cases, the type of valid input, such as number or date) for the fact (which can be filled in Value).
		- Use ALL OF (AND ONLY) these claim facts to write your Prolog encoding for the policy coverage.
	- Finally, I have provided below a set of supporting (pre-defined) Prolog predicates.
		- Under each supporting predicate, I have listed the arguments to the predicate with their category (e.g. atom, number) and a description, as well as a description of what the predicate does.
		- Use ALL OF these supporting predicates to write your Prolog encoding for the policy coverage.
- The Prolog rule that you encode, 'covered(C)', must incorporate all relevant criteria from the policy coverage.
- Return only Prolog code in your reply. NO EXPLANATION is necessary.
