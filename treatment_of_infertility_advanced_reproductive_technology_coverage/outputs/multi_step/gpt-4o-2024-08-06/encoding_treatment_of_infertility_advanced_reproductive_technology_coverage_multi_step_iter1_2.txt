Here is the revised encoding, which improves clarity, conciseness, and consistency:

```prolog
:- import('../../rules.hrf').
:- import('../../../../Cardinal Care Core/Precertification Required/rules.hrf').
:- import('../../Non-basic Infertility Services/rules.hrf').

% Main rule to check if a service is covered
covered(C) :-
    claim_service_type(C, Type),
    Type \= other_service,
    eligibility_check(C, Type),
    precertified_if_necessary(C),
    claim_location_service_received(C, Location),
    Location \= other.

% Eligibility check based on service type
eligibility_check(C, ivf_for_fertility_preservation) :-
    ivf_eligibility(C).

eligibility_check(C, cryopreservation_for_fertility_preservation) :-
    cryopreservation_eligibility(C).

% IVF eligibility criteria
ivf_eligibility(C) :-
    claim_patient_is_believed_to_be_fertile(C, yes),
    claim_planned_service(C, PlannedService),
    PlannedService \= other,
    claim_will_be_retrieving_eggs_for_use(C, yes),
    is_gonadotoxic_treatment(PlannedService).

% Cryopreservation eligibility criteria
cryopreservation_eligibility(C) :-
    claim_patient_is_believed_to_be_fertile(C, yes),
    claim_planned_service(C, PlannedService),
    PlannedService \= other,
    claim_will_be_retrieving_eggs_for_use(C, yes),
    (claim_patient_has_premature_ovarian_failure(C, yes),

    meets_cpb_egg_sperm_contact_trial_reqs(C);
    claim_inseminations_not_expected_to_be_effective_and_ivf_expected_to_be_only_effective_treatment(C, yes)).

% Gonadotoxic treatment verification
is_gonadotoxic_treatment(Service) :-
    member(Service, [chemotherapy, pelvic_radiotherapy, gonadotoxic_therapy, orchiectomy, oophorectomy, hysterectomy, 
                     orchiectomy_for_treatment_of_disease, oophorectomy_for_treatment_of_disease,

    get_timestamp_from_date(DOB, BirthTS),
    get_timestamp_from_date(DateReceived, ReceivedTS),
    datetime_difference_in_years(BirthTS, ReceivedTS, Age).

datetime_difference_in_years(BirthTS, ReceivedTS, Age) :-
    evaluate(datediff(BirthTS, ReceivedTS, years), Age).

% Services requiring precertification
requires_precertification(ivf_for_fertility_preservation).
requires_precertification(cryopreservation_for_fertility_preservation).
```

### Key Changes
1. **Modularization**: The revised code organizes eligibility checks into separate predicates.
2. **Conciseness**: Removed unnecessary repetition of eligibility checks by introducing `eligibility_check/2`.
3. **Readability**: Simplified conditionals and used descriptive names for predicates.
4. **Use of Lists**: Used `member/2` for the gonadotoxic treatments to consolidate conditional checks.
