Eligible health services include Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) services. ART services are more advanced medical procedures or treatments.

1) ART services:
ART services include:
	•	In vitro fertilization (IVF) for fertility preservation
	•	Cryopreservation (freezing) and storage for eggs, embryos, sperm, or reproductive tissue for fertility preservation

The following are not covered under the infertility treatment benefit:
• ART services are not provided for out-of-network care

2) Fertility preservation:
Fertility preservation involves the retrieval of mature eggs and/or sperm or the creation of embryos that are frozen for future use.
You are eligible for fertility preservation only when you:
	•	Are believed to be fertile
	•	Have planned services that will result in infertility such as:
	•	Chemotherapy
	•	Pelvic radiotherapy
	•	Other gonadotoxic therapies
	•	Ovarian or testicular removal
	•	Bilateral orchiectomy (removal of both testicles)
	•	Bilateral oophorectomy (removal of both ovaries)
	•	Hysterectomy (removal of the uterus)
	•	Chemotherapy or radiation therapy that is established in medical literature to result in infertility
	•	The eggs that will be retrieved for use are reasonably likely to result in a successful pregnancy by meeting the FSH level and ovarian responsiveness criteria outlined in Aetna’s infertility clinical policy.
3) Aetna Infertility Clinical Policy:

3a) ART Eligibility and Trial Requirements
2. For plans with an Advanced Reproductive Technology (ART) benefit (please check benefit plan descriptions), less invasive therapeutic approaches should be attempted prior to undertaking more invasive procedures, as directed by an appropriate, licensed medical specialist. The medical necessity criteria in the Advanced Reproductive Technology section below are met for persons who are unable to conceive after an appropriate trial of egg-sperm contact. For women under 35 years of age, an appropriate trial of egg-sperm contact requires 12 months of regular intravaginal inseminations or 4 cycles of timed intrauterine or intracervical inseminations, documented in the medical record.  For women 35 years of age and older, an appropriate trial of egg-sperm contact requires 6 months of regular intravaginal inseminations or 3 cycles of timed intrauterine or intracervical insemination, documented in the medical record. This requirement applies to all individuals regardless of sexual orientation or the availability of a reproductive partner.  For IVF procedures under the ART benefit, these requirements for a trial of egg-sperm contact are waived for persons for whom intravaginal, intrauterine, or intracervical inseminations would not be expected to be effective and IVF procedures are the only effective treatment (see In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Procedures subsection below.) 

3b) In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Procedures
Aetna considers the following in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures medically necessary for persons who meet any of the following criteria:
a. Women who have failed to conceive after a trial of ovulation induction:
	•	i. For women 37 years of age or younger, three cycles of oral or injectable ovulation induction (with or without intravaginal, intrauterine, or intracervical inseminations); or
	•	ii. For women 38 years of age or older, no trial of ovulation induction is required.
b. Persons for whom intravaginal, intrauterine, or intracervical inseminations would not be expected to be effective and IVF would be expected to be the only effective treatment, including:
	•	i. Men with azoospermia or severe deficits in semen quality or quantity (see Appendix); or
	•	ii. Women with tubal factor infertility:
	•	a. Bilateral tubal disease (e.g., salpingitis isthmica nodosum, tubal obstruction, absence, or hydrosalpinges).
	•	b. Endometriosis stage 3 or 4 (see Appendix).
	•	c. Failure to conceive after pelvic surgery with restoration of normal pelvic anatomy (e.g., myomectomy of cavitary-obscuring myomata, resection of intrauterine adhesions or uterine septum, or surgical reconstruction of tubal disease):
	i.	After regular egg-sperm contact for 6 months if less than 40 years of age.
	ii.	After regular egg-sperm contact for 3 months if 40 years of age or older.
	•	d. Unilateral hydrosalpinx with failure to conceive:
	i.	After regular egg-sperm contact for 12 months if less than 40 years of age.
	ii.	After regular egg-sperm contact for 6 months if 40 years of age or older.
	•	iii. Inadvertent ovarian hyperstimulation (estradiol level greater than 1,000 pg/ml plus greater than 3 follicles greater than 16 mm or 4 to 8 follicles greater than 14 mm or a larger number of smaller follicles) during preparation for a planned stimulated cycle in women less than 38 years of age.
	•	iv. Women who have had a hysterectomy or who have a medical contraindication to pregnancy, such as severe cardiac disease, or have a medical condition that requires the mother to ingest a fetotoxic agent.
	Note: Some plans limit and/or exclude coverage for gestational surrogacy; please check benefit plan descriptions.


3c) Eligibility for ART Using Own Eggs Based on Ovarian Reserve
Some plans exclude coverage of Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) using a woman's own eggs for women with poor ovarian reserve. Ovarian reserve is determined by measurement of menstrual cycle day 3 serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) drawn after the normal onset of menstruation, or after progesterone induced menstruation for women who do not reliably menstruate. For women 39 years of age and older, ovarian responsiveness is determined by measurement of day 3 FSH obtained within the prior 6 months. For women who are less than 40 years of age, the day 3 FSH must be less than 19 mIU/mL in their most recent laboratory test to use their own eggs. For women 40 years of age and older, their unmedicated day 3 FSH must be less than 19 mIU/mL in all prior tests to use their own eggs. Please check benet plan descriptions. 

3d) Coverage Limitations for Women 40 and Older and Premature Ovarian Failure
ART services for women 40 years of age and older with natural menopause is not covered because it is not considered medically necessary treatment of disease; natural menopause is not considered a disease. For women 40 years of age and older, their unmedicated day 3 FSH must be less than 19 mIU/mL in all prior tests to document that they are not menopausal and eligible for coverage of ART. Women who are less than 40 years of age who have a day 3 FSH greater than 19 mIU/L are considered to have the disease of premature ovarian failure (also known as premature ovarian insufficiency, primary ovarian insufficiency, or hypergonadotropic hypogonadism). For women with premature ovarian failure, ART (in vitro fertilization) services are considered medically necessary until they reach 45 years of age. Women 40 years of age and older with premature ovarian failure may submit a new unmedicated D3 FSH level to utilize her own oocytes (even if she has had an elevated D3 FSH level above 40 years of age in the past). For women 40 years of and older with premature ovarian failure, the day 3 FSH must be less than 19 mIU/mL in their most recent laboratory test to use their own eggs. Please check benefit plan descriptions.
