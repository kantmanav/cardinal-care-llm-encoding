- I have given you a benefit (section) of an insurance policy below.
	- Each 'service' or coverage provision is described under numbered headings, with the name of the service followed by the conditions for coverage under that service.
	- Some sections also specify exclusions or additional requirements (for example, ART services not covered out-of-network, or additional criteria for fertility preservation).
	- The policy references external documents (Aetna Infertility Clinical Policy and Aetna Student Health Plan Design and Benefits Summary) that include eligibility requirements, trial requirements, and coverage limitations based on age, ovarian reserve, and other factors.
- Please encode an Epilog rule, 'covered(C)', which is true exactly when the person making a claim, 'C', on the policy is eligible for coverage. Incorporate all listed criteria, including the provisions for Advanced Reproductive Technology (ART), fertility preservation, and any specified requirements or exclusions from the Aetna Infertility Clinical Policy and the Aetna Student Health Plan Design and Benefits Summary.
- I have also given you a set of facts (atoms) that will be defined in any query to the policy below:
	- Many are of the form 'claim.fact(C, ***')', meaning they will be defined for the claim 'C' by filling in a value for *** (this is essentially a parameter for the claim).
        - Under each of these claim-specific facts, I have listed the valid inputs (in some cases the type of valid input such as number or date) for the fact (which can be filled in for the ***).
	- Others are of the form 'fact(***)', meaning they are not specific to the claim and will be defined generally by filling in a value for ***.
- Please write your Epilog rule, 'covered(C)', in such a manner that it uses these atoms to determine whether the claim 'C' on the policy is eligible for coverage, taking into account all of the contract’s coverage details, exclusions, and conditions.
- Return only Epilog code in your reply. NO EXPLANATION is necessary.
