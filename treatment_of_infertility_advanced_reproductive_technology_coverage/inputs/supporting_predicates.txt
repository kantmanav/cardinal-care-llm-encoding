Below is a list Prolog relations. These relations are imported, so you MUST reference them directly in your encoding without redefining their logic.

1.	patient_age_at_time_of_service(C, Age)
	Arguments:
	• Age (integer): Unifies with the patient’s age at the time of service.
	Description: Unifies Age with the patient’s age computed from the service date and date of birth.
2.	most_recent_day_3_fsh_test(C, fsh_test(Level, Date, Time))
	Arguments:
	• fsh_test(Level, Date, Time) (compound): Unifies with the day‑3 FSH test record that has the latest date and time, where:
        • Level (integer): The hormone level measured in the test.
        • Date (atom): A date represented in the format ‘YYYY_MM_DD’.
        • Time (atom): A time represented in the format ‘HH_MM’.
    Description: Unifies the second argument with the uniquely most recent day‑3 FSH test from the claim by comparing the test dates and times.
3.	day_3_fsh_tests_since_age_40_in_claim(C, Tests)
	Arguments:
	• Tests (list): Unifies with a list of FSH test records whose dates are on or after the patient’s 40th birthday.
	Description: Filters the claim’s FSH tests, unifying Tests with those performed on or after the patient reaches age 40.
4.	exists_test_with_level_at_least_19(Tests)
	Arguments:
	• Tests (list): A list of day‑3 FSH test records.
	Description: Succeeds if at least one test in Tests has a hormone level of 19 or greater.
5.	leq_n_months_diff(EarlierDate, LaterDate, N)
	Arguments:
	• EarlierDate (atom): A date in the expected format representing the earlier date.
	• LaterDate (atom): A date representing the later date.
	• N (integer): The maximum allowed difference in months.
	Description: Succeeds if the difference between LaterDate and EarlierDate is less than or equal to N months.
